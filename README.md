# LOMHAs
Detect the loci with multiple haplotypes (LOMHAs) in the hybrid and parental populations using DNA-based data.

The python script "MALAsHyb.py" is for detecting the the loci with multiple haplotypes in the hybrid population. It takes the fasta files of the hybrid individuals with ".fa" extension from the current working directory as an input and gives the "h0DFMultiAlleles" file as output which is made up of locus numbers in the first column and MALAs sequence in the second column of the multi allelic locus alleles in the population of the hybrid species.

The python script "MALAsPar.py" is for detecting whether the haplotypes of the loci with multiple haplotypes are in the populations of maternal and paternal species. It is given the paternal and maternal fasta files (in this order) including all data of all individuals, and it takes the output file "h0DFMultiAlleles" of the script "MALAsHyb.py" as inputs. It gives three output files "P_h0DFMultiAlleles" having haplotypes of LOMHAs in the paternal species, "M_h0DFMultiAlleles" having haplotypes of LOMHAs in the maternal species, and "MP_h0DFMultiAlleles" having haplotypes of LOMHAs present in both maternal and paternal species. These files are made up of two columns one of which has number of locus and second column has the haplotypes of the LOMHAs sequence.
